# Fourier-Neural-Operator
A few experiences on Fourier Neural Operators. 
- **nonhomogeneousbc**: FNO architecture on a 2D reaction-diffusion PDE with time-dependent Neumann boundary conditions. This has been done after finding mixed opinions on whether FNO can be used with non homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.
